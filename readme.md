when you are using the "register" please rember that it is in this format:
register x y 

x = what is the registory.
y = what you want to register.

to see the output you need to type "out" e.g:
out x y

x = register you want to display
y = doesn't do anything just there so the code doesn't break

To "add" a register and a value together you need to have:
add x y

x = register you want to add and store the final reasult 
y = the amount you want to add
use ";" as comments
